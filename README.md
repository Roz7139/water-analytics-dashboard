# Water Quality Data Analytics Project

This project uses the [Water Potability dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability) to showcase a complete exploratory data analysis pipeline using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Goals

- Clean and prepare real-world environmental data
- Use statistics and visualization to analyze drinking water safety
- Identify potential risk indicators for non-potable water

## Key Features

- Missing value handling and imputation
- Grouped distribution analysis (potable vs. non-potable)
- T-tests for statistical significance
- Visual summaries using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Tools

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Source

- [Kaggle: Water Potability](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

## Insights

- Over 60% of samples are not potable
- pH, TDS, and Organic Carbon show key differences between classes
- Correlation is weak, but domain-based thresholds reveal valuable patterns
